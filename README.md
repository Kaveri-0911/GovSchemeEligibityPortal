# 🏛️ Government Schemes Portal – One Platform for All Welfare Benefits

**Built for INNOHACK 2025 by Team HackStack**  
A centralized web platform to help Indian citizens discover, explore, and apply for government schemes based on their eligibility.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Citizens often miss out on welfare schemes due to:
- Scattered and unorganized scheme data across websites
- Unclear eligibility criteria
- Lack of awareness and accessibility

Despite hundreds of government schemes being available, there’s no unified platform to search and filter schemes based on personal eligibility.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We created a **user-friendly web app** that lists government schemes (central and state) and allows users to:
- Search and filter schemes based on eligibility (age, income, category)
- View scheme details, required documents, and application links
- Get notified about recently added schemes
- Use an **admin panel** to add/update schemes in real-time

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Filter schemes by age, income, category (students, farmers, women, etc.)
- 📄 View detailed scheme information with documents and links
- 🛠️ Admin dashboard to add/edit schemes dynamically
- 🆕 “Recently Added” tag for new schemes
- ⚡ Fast and responsive UI
